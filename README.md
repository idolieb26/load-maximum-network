# OSMnx Example

Write a Python notebook that uses OSMnx to query the road network and extract the graph that maximizes the sum of a given edge attribute and the coverage given a total distance (say 1000km)

## Getting Started

### 1. Set up your environment

If you are **cloning this repo**, run the following command preferably inside your virtual environment to install all dependencies:

```Shell
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt # (Python 3)
``` 

And then create a virtual environment (highly recommended):
- To **create** virtual environment:
    ```Shell
    $ python3 -m venv venv # using Python's venv
    # or
    $ virtualenv venv # using virtualenv
    ``` 
- To **activate** virtual environment (Linux/Mac OS):
    ```Shell
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ``` 

- Install all dependencies:
    ```Shell
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt # (Python 3)

### 2. Run jupyter notebook
```Shell
jupyter notebook
```
